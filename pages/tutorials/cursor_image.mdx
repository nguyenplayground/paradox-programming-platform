# How to change cursor image in pygame

In case you want to create and use your own colorfully customized cursor from an image (and display different cursors depending on where you are in the game, e.g. in the menu or "ingame").

This is how to do it:

set mouse visibility to false
create a customized image you want to use as cursor
create a rect from that customized cursor image
update the rects position to your (invisible) mouse position
draw the image at the location of the rect
Here is a short code example:

"""
  pygame.mouse.set_visible(False)
  cursor_img_rect = cursor_img.get_rect()

  while True:
      # in your main loop update the position every frame and blit the image    
      cursor_img_rect.center = pygame.mouse.get_pos()  # update position 
      gameDisplay.blit(cursor_img, cursor_img_rect) # draw the cursor
"""
